## Data Cleaning and Preparation
### Duplicate Values 
After importing the database and values from the .csv file in the MySQL workbench, I checked for duplicate values. Duplicate values may lead to inaccurate analysis.
There appears to be 0 duplicate entries across all columns.

### Null Values
Checking for null values involves identifying any missing or undefined data in each column.
There were no null values found in the dataset.
